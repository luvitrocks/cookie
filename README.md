# Cookie

> Basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers in [Luvit.io](https://luvit.io).

## Install

```bash
lit install voronianski/cookie
```

## API

```lua
local Cookie = require('cookie')
local cookie = Cookie:new()
```

### cookie:parse(str, options)

Parse HTTP `Cookie` header string and returning a table of all cookie name-value pairs. The `str` argument is the string representing a `Cookie` header value and `options` is an optional table containing additional parsing options.

```lua
local cookies = cookie:parse('foo=bar; equation=E%3Dmc%5E2');
-- { foo = 'bar', equation = 'E=mc^2' }
```

#### Options

`cookie:parse` accepts these properties in the options table.

##### decode

Specifies a function that will be used to decode a cookie's value. Since the value of a cookie has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to decode a previously-encoded cookie value into a Lua string or table.

The default function is the built-in [`querystring.urldecode`](https://luvit.io/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_urldecode_str), which will decode any URL-encoded sequences into their byte representations.

### cookie:serialize(name, value, options)

Serialize a cookie name-value pair into a `Set-Cookie` header string. The `name` argument is the name for the cookie, the `value` argument is the value to set the cookie to, and the `options` argument is an optional table containing additional serialization options.

```lua
local setCookie = cookie:serialize('foo', 'bar');
-- foo=bar
```

#### Options

`cookie:serialize` accepts these properties in the options table.

##### domain

Specifies the value for the [`Domain` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.3]. By default, no domain is set, and most clients will consider the cookie to apply to only the current domain.

##### encode

Specifies a function that will be used to encode a cookie's value. Since value of a cookie has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to encode a value into a string suited for a cookie's value.

The default function is the built-in [`querystring.urlencode`](https://luvit.io/api/querystring.html#querystring_querystring_urlencode_str), which will encode a Lua string into UTF-8 byte sequences and then URL-encode any that fall outside of the cookie range.

##### expires

Specifies the `os.date` to be the value for the [`Expires` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.1]. By default, no expiration is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

**note** the [cookie storage model specification][rfc-6266-5.3] states that if both `expires` and `magAge` are set, then `maxAge` takes precedence, but it is possible not all clients by obey this, so if both are set, they should point to the same date and time.

##### httpOnly

Specifies the `boolean` value for the [`HttpOnly` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.6]. When truthy, the `HttpOnly` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is not set.

**note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not allow client-side JavaScript to see the cookie in `document.cookie`.

##### maxAge

Specifies the `number` (in seconds) to be the value for the [`Max-Age` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.2].
The given number will be converted to an integer by rounding down. By default, no maximum age is set.

**note** the [cookie storage model specification][rfc-6266-5.3] states that if both `expires` and `magAge` are set, then `maxAge` takes precedence, but it is possible not all clients by obey this, so if both are set, they should point to the same date and time.

##### path

Specifies the value for the [`Path` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.4]. By default, the path is considered the ["default path"][rfc-6266-5.1.4]. By default, no maximum age is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

##### secure

Specifies the `boolean` value for the [`Secure` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6266-5.2.5]. When truthy, the `Secure` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `Secure` attribute is not set.

**note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not send the cookie back to the server in the future if the browser does not have an HTTPS connection.

### cookie:sign(value, secret)

Sign the given `value` with `secret`.

```lua
local signed = cookie:sign('hello', 'tobiiscool')
-- 'hello.0c60d4906948902ccfcfe0b4074eb814d8077448e8c7b721f2d3811ac959e502'
```

### cookie:unsign(value, secret)

Unsign and decode the given `value` with `secret`. It returns `false` if the signature is invalid.

```lua
local signed = cookie:sign('hello', 'tobiiscool')

cookie:unsign(signed, 'tobiiscool')
-- 'hello'

cookie:unsign(signed, 'luna')
-- false
```

### cookie:parseJSONCookie(value)

Parse a cookie value as a JSON cookie. This will return the parsed JSON value if it was a JSON cookie.

### cookie:parseJSONCookies(table)

Given a table, this will iterate over the keys and call `parseJSONCookie` on each value. This will return the same table passed in.

```lua
local cookie = cookie:parseJSONCookie('j:{"foo":"bar"}')
-- { foo = 'bar' }
```

### cookie:parseSignedCookie(value, secret)

Parse a cookie value as a signed cookie. This will return the parsed unsigned value if it was a signed cookie and the signature was valid.

### cookie:parseSignedCookies(table, secret)

Given a table, this will iterate over the keys and check if any value is a signed cookie. If it is a signed cookie and the signature is valid, the key will be deleted from the table and added to the new table that is returned.


```lua
local cookie = cookie:parseSignedCookie('s:hello.0c60d4906948902ccfcfe0b4074eb814d8077448e8c7b721f2d3811ac959e502')
-- hello
```

## Tests

```bash
lit install
luvit ./test
```
